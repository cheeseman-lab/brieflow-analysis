# Brieflow Analysis Template

Template repository for storing configurations and outputs when analyzing optical pooled screens using [Brieflow](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow).


## Overview

This repository is designed to work with Brieflow to analyze optical pooled screens.
Follow these steps to get set up for a screen analysis!

### 1. Screen Analysis Repository Setup

Brieflow-analysis is a template for each screen analysis.
Create a new respository for a screen to get started.

1) Create a new screen repository wih the "Use this template" button for each new screen analysis.

2) *Optional*: Add template brieflow-analysis template as an upstream reference in screen repository:
`git remote add template https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow-analysis`

### 2. Brielfow Setup

We use [Brieflow](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow) to process data on a very large scale from each screen.
**Note:** We use Brieflow as a git submodule in this repository.
Please see the [Git Submodules basic explanation](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) for information on how to best install, use, and update this submodule.

1) Clone the Brieflow package into this repo using the following git submodule commands:

```sh
# init git submodule
git submodule init
# clone brieflow
git submodule update 
```

2) Set up Brieflow following the [setup instructions](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow#brieflow-setup).
To set up the Brieflow Conda environment:

```sh
# enter brieflow directory
cd brieflow/
# create brieflow_main_env conda environment
conda env create --file=brieflow_main_env.yml
# activate brieflow_main_env conda environment
conda activate brieflow_main_env
# set conda installation to use strict channel priorities
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

**Note:** We recommend making a custom Brieflow environment if you need other packages for Brieflow modifications.
Simply change the name of the `brieflow_main_env` Conda environment and track your added packages in [brieflow/brieflow_main_env.yml](brieflow/brieflow_main_env.yml).

We use the HPC integration for Slurm as detailed in the setup instructions.

3) *Optional*: Track changes to computational processing in a new branch on your fork.
Contribute these changes to the main version of Brieflow with a PR as described in the Brieflow [contribution notes](https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/brieflow?tab=readme-ov-file#contribution-notes).

### 3. Start Analysis

Follow the full instructions below to run an analysis.
`analysis/` contains configuration notebooks used to configure processes and slurm scripts used to run full modules.
By default, results are output to `analysis/analysis_root` and organized by analysis module (preprocess, sbs, phenotype, etc).


## Analysis Steps

Follow the instructions below to configure parameters and run modules.
All of these steps are done in the example analysis.
Use the following command to enter this folder:
`cd analysis/`.

***Note**: Use `brieflow_main_env` Conda environment for each configuration notebook.

### Step 0: Configure preprocess parameters

Follow the steps in [0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb](analysis/0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb) to configure preprocess params.

**Note:** This step determines where ND2 data is loaded from (can be from anywhere) and where intermediate/output data is saved (can also be anywhere).
By default, results are output to `analysis/analysis_root`.

### Step 1: Run preprocessing module

**Local**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh 1.run_preprocessing.sh
```
**Slurm**:

Change `NUM_PLATES` to the number of plates you are processing (to process each plate separately).

```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sbatch 1.run_preprocessing_slurm.sh
```

***Note**: For testing purposes, users may only have generated sbs or phenotype images.
It is possible to test only SBS/phenotype preprocessing in this notebook.
See notebook instructions for more details.

### Step 2: Configure SBS parameters

Follow the steps in [2.configure_sbs_params.ipynb](analysis/2.configure_sbs_params.ipynb) to configure SBS module parameters.

### Step 3: Configure phenotype parameters

Follow the steps in [3.configure_phenotype_params.ipynb](analysis/3.configure_phenotype_params.ipynb) to configure phenotype module parameters.

### Step 4: Run SBS/phenotype modules

**Local**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh 4.run_sbs_phenotype.sh
```
**Slurm**:

Change `NUM_PLATES` to the number of plates you are processing (to process each plate separately).

```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sbatch 4.run_sbs_phenotype_slurm.sh
```

### Step 5: Configure merge process params

Follow the steps in [5.configure_merge_params.ipynb](analysis/5.configure_merge_params.ipynb) to configure merge process params.

### Step 6: Run merge process

**Local**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh 6.run_merge.sh
```
**Slurm**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sbatch 6.run_merge_slurm.sh
```

### Step 7: Configure aggregate process params

Follow the steps in [7.configure_aggregate_params.ipynb](analysis/7.configure_aggregate_params.ipynb) to configure aggregate process params.

### Step 8: Run aggregate process

**Local**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh 8.run_aggregate.sh
```
**Slurm**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sbatch 8.run_aggregate_slurm.sh
```

### Step 9: Configure cluster process params

Follow the steps in [9.configure_cluster_params.ipynb](analysis/9.configure_cluster_params.ipynb) to configure cluster process params.

### Step 10: Run cluster process

**Local**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh 10.run_cluster.sh
```
**Slurm**:
```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sbatch 10.run_cluster_slurm.sh
```

***Note**: Many users will want to only run SBS or phenotype processing, independently.
It is possible to restrict the SBS/phenotype processing with the following:
1) If either of the sample dataframes defined in [0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb](analysis/0.configure_preprocess_params.ipynb) are empty then no samples will be processed.
See the notebook for more details.
2) By varying the tags in the `4.run_sbs_phenotype` sh files (`--until all_sbs` or `--until all_phenotype`), the analysis will only run only the analysis of interest.

## Generate Rulegraph

Run the following script to generate a rulegraph of Brieflow:

```sh
conda activate brieflow_main_env
sh generate_rulegraph.sh
```
